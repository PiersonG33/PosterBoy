This document defines the schema used to construct the database for PosterBoy.

Django's default database schema is used to store sitewide user accounts.
PosterBoy also stores information about each board, post, user roles on boards, and
user actions on boards.

To do this, we have the following tables.

Posts
- id, integer, primary key
- userid, integer, foreign key referencing auth_user(id)
- boardid, integer, foreign key references boards(id)
- message, up to 200 characters
- message_type, integer (identifies whether content is text or img)
- date, timestamp
- color, integer
- coordinates, point
- score, integer
