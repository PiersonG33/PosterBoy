This document defines the schema used to construct the database for PosterBoy.

Django's default database schema is used to store sitewide user accounts.
PosterBoy also stores information about each board, post, user roles on boards, and
user actions on boards.

To do this, we have the following tables.

Posts
- id, integer, primary key
- userid, integer, foreign key referencing auth_user(id)
- boardid, integer, foreign key references boards(id)
- message, up to 200 characters
- message_type, integer (identifies whether content is text or img)
- date, timestamp
- color, integer
- x, integer
- y, integer
- score, integer

Boards
- id, integer, primary key
- topic_name, up to 50 characters
- actions, integer (number of actions per interval of reset)
- reset, interval (interval that actions reset on)

UserActions
- id, integer, primary key
- postid, int, foreign key referencing posts(id)
- userid, int, foreign key referencing auth_user(id)
- boardid, int, foreign key referencing boards(id)
- action, up to 10 characters
- date, timestamp

UserStatus
- userid, integer, foreign key referencing auth_user(id)
- boardid, integer, foreign key referencing boards(id)
- role, up to 10 characters
- (userid, boardid) forms a primary key



Triggers needed:
one trigger to check if an attempted post is legal and if so, create a corresponding action
one trigger to check if a user action about a post is legal and if so, update the post's score
one trigger to archive posts with a 0 or negative score
