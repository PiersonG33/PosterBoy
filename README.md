## Brainstorming
**Ideas to transform into reality (or not)**
1. Temporary “notes” - nothing is permanent
2. Users can delete other user’s posts, not just their own

**We’re open to feedback**. PosterBoy revolves around providing users with a unique digital environment to share ideas where only the *best* survive. If you have any feedback on something we could do better, or an idea for our website, please reach out to our team.
